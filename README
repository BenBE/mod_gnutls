mod_gnutls 

This module started back in September of 2004 because I was tired of trying to
fix bugs in mod_ssl.  mod_ssl is a giant beast of a module -- no offense to it's 
authors is intended -- but I believe it has fallen prey to massive feature bloat.

When I started hacking on httpd, mod_ssl remained a great mystery to me, and 
when I actually looked at it, I ran away.  The shear ammount code is huge, and it 
does not conform to the style guidelines.  It was painful to read, and even harder
to debug.  I wanted to understand how it worked, and I had recently heard about 
GnuTLS, so long story short, I decided to implement a mod_gnutls.

Lines of Code in mod_ssl: 15,324
Lines of Code in mod_gnutls: 1,886

Because of writing mod_gnutls, I now understand how input and output filters work, 
better than I ever thought possible.  It was a little painful at times, and some parts
lift code and ideas directly from mod_ssl. Kudos to the original authors of mod_ssl.

Current Status:
- SSL and TLS connections with all popular browsers work!
- Sets some enviromental vars for scripts
- Supports Memcached as a distributed SSL Session Cache
- Supports DBM as a local SSL Session Cache

Future Development:
- Support for Server Name Indication (partial support is in, but disabled)
- Support for Client Certificates

Basic Configuration:

LoadModule gnutls_module  modules/mod_gnutls.so

# mod_gnutls can optionaly use a memcached server to store it's SSL Sessions.
# This is useful in a cluster enviroment, where you want all of your servers 
# to share a single SSL Session Cache.
#GnuTLSCache memcache "127.0.0.1 server2.example.com server3.example.com"

# The Default method is to use a DBM backed Cache.  It isn't super fast, but 
# it is portable and does not require another server to be running like memcached.
GnuTLSCache dbm conf/gnutls_cache

<VirtualHost 1.2.3.4:443>
    # insert other directives ... here ...

    # This enables the mod_gnutls Handlers for this Virtual Host
    GnuTLSEnable On

    # This is the Private key for your server.
    GnuTLSKeyFile conf/server.key

    # This is the Server Certificate.  
    GnuTLSCertificateFile conf/server.cert
</VirtualHost>
